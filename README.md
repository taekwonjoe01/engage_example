Lots left To Do:
-Refactor string assets to the strings.xml for localization options.
-Consider how to store the queries stock data locally on device (other than just caching it).
-Create an adapter to show more than the latest day of stock details in the details page.
-Create unit tests.
-Do a UX review and create custom colors/styles for our application instead of using default generated UI.
-Refactor "Loading" strings to use loading spinners/progress bars.
-Optimize queries and caching model.
-Create UI that displays networking errors, at the moment, networking errors don't show on the UI (but they are handled!).
